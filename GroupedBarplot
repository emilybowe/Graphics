#data description 
#the data I was working with had 3 headings across
# "supplement", "diet" and "gain"
# "supplement" is the food supplement type, categorical (Control, Agrimore, Supergain, Supersupp)
# "diet" is the food type, cateogircal (Barley, Oats, Wheat) 
# "gain" is continous, and is weight gain in Kg

#sample data 
#supplement	diet	gain
#Agrimore	wheat	19.54688
