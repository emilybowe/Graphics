#data description 
#the data I was working with had 4 headings across
# "name", "class", "brainmass" and "bodymass"
# "name" is the animal name
# "class" is categorical, and is either "Aves" or "Mammalia"
# "brainmass" is continuous, and is the brain mass in g
# "bodymass" is continuous, and is the body mass in g
 
#sample data 
#name	class	brainmass	bodymass
#Mole	Mammalia	3.00	1.2200e+02
