# The data I was working with had 2 columns, "time" and "species"
# The data was measuring the amount of species found in an area, per time (mins) spent looking. 
# As there are a finite number of species in an area,
# at a certain point the rate of species found will slow even though time spent searching increases at the same rate.
# this relationship needs a line that will reflect that

#sample data
